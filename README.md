# markov-chains
Markov chains experiment

How much we can predict using the links (Doublets from LinksPlatform) and markov chains?

What if we will make them recursive?

At the same time links can provide a universal way to flattern all network/recursion. And a way to tokenize everything.

Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZeIEiBrT_w and https://moebio.com/mind

What if we learn probabilities of markov chains and just add additional layer of random choices. Would we end with something similar to GPT?

Do we need addtional attention mechanism, or it is just and optimization trick that was required to make GPTs parallelazible?
